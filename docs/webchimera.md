### To be able to export your subtitles to Opensubtitles.org you need to do several things first:

* Provide your credentials for Opensubtitles.org
* Load an appropriate video file
* Input or retrieve a correct IMDB identifier

Those are quirements of [Opensubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org/) itself, there is nothing we can do to lift them.
